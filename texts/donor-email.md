Hi [current donor],

I hope this email finds you well! Attached please find a first draft of the report you requested on the design of Phase I of the evaluation where we have included our thoughts about the feasibility of the timeline and a list of short term and long term outcomes that we plan to collect from each of the schools. Please send us feedback on the draft so far. 

We were unclear on the third section in which you ask for dissemination plans. We didnâ€™t understand exactly what you meant by this question. Can you clarify what types of plans you would like to see in section three? 

Best,
Emily
