The items on this checklist are meant to serve as a guide on what a reviewer should look for when reading code. It lists common issues we have found in the past. Note that this is not an exhaustive list and that not all items will apply to every code being reviewed. Think of it as a starting point and use your judgment on whether an item is relevant or whether there are any issues in the code that are not listed below ([suggestions and contributions are very welcome!](https://github.com/DevInnovationLab/guides#how-to-contribute)).

During the review, read each line of code and indicate whenever you encounter any of the issues described below. This can be done by adding comments directly to the code, to a pull request, or in a separate document. If you choose the latter, you can download the checklist in Word or markdown format below. In this case, write down the lines of the code in which you have identified each potential issue. Whatever approach you take, read the code carefully, be constructive in your feedback, indicate what changes you would suggest, and point out which items are creating bugs, which ones would make the code more accessible, and [which ones are more trivial suggestions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27810522/what-does-nit-mean-in-hacker-speak#:~:text=Sometimes%20the%20reviewer%20will%20prefix,we'd%20like%20you%20to.&text=A%20%22nit%22%20means%20a%20trivial,it%20may%20be%20an%20acronym.), such as style issues.
