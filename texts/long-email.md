Dear all,

It was a pleasure to meet you all in person a few weeks ago at the NBER conference in Boston. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us at the conference. We really enjoyed learning from your whole team. 

I am writing to see if you would be interested in continuing these conversations or discussing a possible plan for moving forward with the partnership. Would your team be available in the next few weeks for a call?

Thank you very much, I look forward to speaking with you again soon. 

Best,
Emily
