When we looked at the endline exam data for students in grades 3 through 6, we found that these students had the highest literacy gains of all of the students in the study. The endline exam was administered by our team to 2,000 students, and the results were disaggregated to determine which regions performed best. Unfortunately, region 1 showed much less improvement than regions 2 or 3.
