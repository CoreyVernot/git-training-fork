Hi [Name],

I just wanted to give you a quick update about the project I’m working on since I know that’s going to be important for the Q3 report. As you know, the last time I updated you, I was working on finalizing [X], and I just needed [Y] to get to the final phase of the project.

As of today, we’re almost completely on track to be done by the EOM deadline. The only thing holding us back is getting feedback from the data team. I’ve been reaching out every day, and I finally heard back today, so that should be getting back on track too, assuming they deliver by the end of the week. I’ll keep you posted if not, of course. Other than that, we’re doing good. I think the project will be a great addition to the Q3 report.

I’ve attached some screenshots of the presentation so far. Keep in mind that it’s a working draft, and a lot could change before it’s ready to be presented to the company, but I do think the first ten slides are pretty set.

Thanks,
