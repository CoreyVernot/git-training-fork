Hi [Name],

It was so nice to see you the other day. It actually got me thinking. As you know, peer reviews are coming up in the next few weeks. I was hoping you might be able to be one of my peer reviewers this quarter, if you’re available. No worries if not! I totally understand. And of course, I’d be happy to reciprocate.

Specifically, I thought you’d be a good person to ask since we worked together on [X] this past month. I think your perspective would be a really useful way to examine my skills, how I might have grown, and what I should keep working on going forward.

Can you let me know if you’re up to being one of my peer reviewers this quarter? (I was hoping to finalize my peer reviewers by [date], so if you could get back by then, that would be amazing.) Also, feel free to send along any questions you may have. I’m always happy to help.

Thanks!
