Hi [Name],

Hope you’re having a great week. I was looking around the company Wiki to see if I could find the answer to your question, but it doesn’t seem to be there, so I asked my manager and they said [X], but I don’t think that’s exactly what you were looking for here, so I kept looking.

Long story short, it looks like there are three possible answers to your question: [A], [B], or [C]. I’m not sure which would best fit your specific needs, so if I’m off base, just let me know. If so, I was wondering if you could send me some more context about the project you’re working on. I think that might help me figure out exactly what you’re going for here.

Anyways, I know you’re under a pretty tight deadline, so I wanted to get this information to you as fast as possible. I do have some extra time this week, so if you need me to go back in, again, I’m happy to keep digging. I’m just not totally sure I know if I’m going in the right direction here.

Hope you’re having a good week.

Best,
