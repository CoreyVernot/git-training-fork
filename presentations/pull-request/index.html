						## Why do code review?

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">To share knowledge</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">To create familiarity with the code base inside a team</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">To improve code reproducibility and transferrability</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">For some peace of mind</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-in">To catch bugs</li>
						</ul>

						Note:
						- Learn by reading other people's code
						- You will need to create a reproducibility package at the end of a project or to hand it over. Reviewing code periodically is a way to make sure this is not an overwhelming task
						- RPs are often the only person looking at the code for a project, which can be a lot of responsibility
						- Mention some horror stories 
						- It may seem like a very time-consuming task, but it will save you time in the long run, specially if you do it often

						## How to do code review?

						- The code author shares a piece of code with the reviewer
						  - For today, choose a script that is as auto-contained as possible, and short enough that someone can understand what it is doing by the end of this session
						- The reviewer reads *every line* of the code and provides feedback
						  - [What to look for when reviewing code](https://devinnovationlab.github.io/guides/templates/code-review.html)
