"Baba O'Riley"
The Who

Out here in the fields
I farm for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
No, I don't need to be forgiven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland
Sally, take my hand
We'll travel south cross land
Put out the fire
And don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy wolds are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older
Come on
Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
Oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted
